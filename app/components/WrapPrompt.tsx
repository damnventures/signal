  return `**TONE & STYLE REQUIREMENTS:**

- Start with casual greeting but get straight to business
- Use concise, punchy language - no corporate speak

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Group content by main themes/topics, not by individual speakers
- When mentioning sources, associate them with their specific topic (e.g., "John Oliver on juvenile justice reform")
- EXCLUDE internal system personas (Malcolm, Craig, Narrative Analyst, etc.)
- For capsules with multiple files, focus on the dominant themes
- Organize topics logically (research → analysis → commentary → entertainment)
- Keep under 50 words for the main summary
- NO emojis, NO special characters, pure text only
