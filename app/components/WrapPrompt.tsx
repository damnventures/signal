- Include specific company names, people, dates, and outcomes when available
- EXCLUDE internal system personas (Malcolm, Craig, Narrative Analyst, etc.)

- Prioritize actionable content, business updates, and concrete information
- Keep between 80-120 words for good detail without being verbose
- Include speaker names and their specific contributions
